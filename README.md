# ðŸ’Š ESP32 Smart Medibox

## ðŸ“– Overview
The Medibox project is a smart medicine management system using an ESP32. It allows users to set alarms, monitor temperature, humidity, and light intensity, and automatically adjusts a servo-controlled shaded window to maintain optimal storage conditions. A Node-RED dashboard provides real-time data visualization and configurable system settings for enhanced usability.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### Time Management & Alarms
- Fetches current time from an NTP server via Wi-Fi (Time Synchronization).  
- Allows time zone configuration.  
- OLED display shows the current time.  
- Set, manage, and delete up to 2 alarms (Alarm Management).  
- View, delete, stop, or snooze alarms (5 minutes).  
- Alarm notifications via buzzer, LED, or OLED messages.  
- Alarm dismissal via push buttons.  
- Persistent storage of alarms and user settings in non-volatile memory.  

### Environmental Monitoring
- Monitors temperature and humidity using DHT11.  
- Issues warnings when values exceed healthy limits:  
  - Temperature: 24Â°Câ€“32Â°C  
  - Humidity: 65%â€“80%  
- Continuous monitoring of environmental conditions.  
- Change detection to minimize power consumption.  

### Light Intensity Monitoring & Control
- Measures light using an LDR sensor at configurable intervals.  
- Averages readings over a period and sends data to Node-RED dashboard.  
- Displays numerical values and historical charts on Node-RED.  
- Servo motor adjusts shaded sliding window based on light intensity.  
- Motor angle calculated considering configurable parameters: minimum angle (Î¸offset), controlling factor (Î³), ideal storage temperature (Tmed).  

### User Interface
- Menu-driven OLED display for easy navigation and configuration.  
- Allows alarm setup, time zone adjustments, and system status checks.  
- Displays warnings when environmental thresholds are exceeded.  

### Communication Management
- Connects securely to an MQTT broker for remote data transmission and control.  
- Publishes sensor data to MQTT topics for Node-RED dashboard visualization.  
- Subscribes to topics for remote control of the servo motor.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### Time & Alarm Management
- ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi and fetches current time from an NTP server.  
- User sets timezone and alarms via OLED menu.  
- Alarm notifications trigger buzzer, LED, and OLED messages.  
- Alarms can be stopped or snoozed via push buttons.  

### Environment Monitoring
- Temperature and humidity are continuously monitored.  
- Alerts are triggered when values exceed healthy limits.  

### Light Control & Automation
- LDR sensors measure ambient light and send averaged data to Node-RED.  
- Servo motor adjusts shaded sliding window based on light and temperature.  
- Node-RED dashboard allows real-time monitoring and parameter adjustments.
